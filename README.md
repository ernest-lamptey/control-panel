# Control Panel - CSS

I took a test that required me to create this panel. I struggled during the test so I decided to research and make a copy of what I was supposed to do in the test. 

The CSS code is very far from optimized and I may not be using the best techniques but I'm still learning and will continue to update the design when I learn more CSS.

Cheers Everyone!
